    <p><strong>Review: Basketball Dog (2018)</strong></p>

    <p><small>4 out of 5 stars</small></p>
    <p>From director<strong> Vicki Fleming </strong>comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Judson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning
        the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.</p>

        <p>This movie has everything you could ask for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li >Basketball</li>
            <li >Adog</li>
            <li >Nail-biting suspense</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and
            the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</p>
